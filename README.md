# Aishvarya M

I am an Integrated M.Sc. student in **Theoretical Computer Science** at PSG College of Technology.  
I am interested in connecting theoretical computer science with practical programming — understanding how algorithmic ideas can be implemented and analysed through code.

I enjoy modelling problems using data structures, implementing algorithms, and reasoning about correctness and efficiency.

## Projects

### Graph-Based Course Prerequisite Tracker (C++)
- Modelled academic course dependencies as a directed graph
- Implemented an adjacency-list representation
- Used recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) to compute prerequisite chains
- Built a file-driven system to load course data and display dependency paths

### Automated Resume Ranking System (C++ / Python)
- Designed a rule-based candidate scoring system using weighted skill matching
- Parsed resume text to extract structured information
- Used hash-based lookup to efficiently process and rank candidates
- Analysed efficiency based on data-structure choice

### Automated Leave Application System (Python)
- Built a Tkinter interface integrated with Selenium automation
- Automated login, navigation, and submission of leave forms on the academic portal
- Reduced manual effort and improved submission accuracy

### Exact vs Approximation Algorithms for Vertex Cover
- Implemented a greedy approximation algorithm and compared it with exact solutions on small graphs
- Studied the trade-off between optimality and computational efficiency

## Problem Solving
- Regular practice of data structures and algorithm problems
- Focus on reasoning about correctness, edge cases, and time complexity
