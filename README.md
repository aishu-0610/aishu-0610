### Aishvarya M

I am an integrated MSc student in Theoretical Computer Science with interests in
algorithms, graph theory, and combinatorial optimisation. I am interested in 
understanding the trade-offs between heuristic methods and solutions with provable 
guarantees for hard computational problems.

**Research interests**
- Graph theory and network algorithms  
- Combinatorial optimisation  
- Approximation algorithms and algorithmic guarantees  

**Selected projects**
- *Exact vs Approximation Algorithms for Vertex Cover*  
  Comparison of an exponential-time exact algorithm and a greedy 2-approximation,
  focusing on optimality–efficiency trade-offs.

- *Graph-Based Course Prerequisite Tracker*  
  Directed graph modelling of academic prerequisites with recursive traversal
  and explicit data structure design.
